Every so often I fire up Xcode on my personal MacBook and start coding up some little app idea that popped into my head. Most of the time these apps end up being throwaways and shortly after I delete it from my machine and forget about it.

Today though, for the first time in a long time, I've followed through one of these little apps all the way to the App Store.

Introducing Elementboard, a periodic table at its simplest â€“ at best, a platform for highschool to early university chemistry learning.

I spun up this project after looking for a simple periodic table app on iOS and realising even though the space is crowded there was little that joined the intersection of feeling like a high quality native experience, while being educational and more than just a simple reference, but also fun.

Elementboard goes further than just being a periodic table reference, though it is a high quality and detailed one if that's all you need. Students can customise their table to suit the style their institution or textbooks use, or just to suit their preference. Elementboard also provides a set of learning features to help students learn the basics of the periodic table of the elements and also to test and further their knowledge through customisable quizzes that can target specific knowledge areas.

Teachers can use Elementboard as a visual teaching aid with filters for class, periods and groups. There is also detailed information on each element.

Elementboard Roadmap (I'll update this post as I go)

- ~~Allow tiles to be configured and to allow hiding/showing of the atomic weight on the table~~ Added 17th July 2023
- ~~A mutable soundscape to increase engagement and use as a teaching aid~~ Added 17th July 2023
- ~~Quiz Builder: A detailed Quiz Builder feature to allow the creation of quizzes similar to the in-built quizzes.~~ Added 26th July 2023
- History Mode: a visual teaching aid for teaching the discovery of the elements over time.
- Theme System: Elementboard currently supports light and dark modes, but I want to take this further and allow users to choose their own theme. Because fun.
- Bohr's Model: an interactive Bohr's model with electronic configuration visualisations.
- Balancing Tutorial/Quizzes: learning mode introducing and evaluating chemical equation balancing.

Elementboard is available now in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/elementboard/id6450800917).
