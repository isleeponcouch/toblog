Internet users of a certain age will remember* LiveJournal. I loved LiveJournal. Alongside Neopets, Weeble and Bob flash cartoons, David Firth videos, eBaum's World, ICQ and other staples of a late 90's early 2000s internet that I grew up on, it was the most lengthy of my daily web sessions over a dial-up internet connection. Probably with Marilyn Manson mp3s being blasted out of Winamp.  

I can't remember what I used to write there. It was so long ago I can't even remember what email address I would have used to sign-up. But there I wrote frequently and lengthily for anybody to see without a care in the world about who read it or what they thought about it. That's not to say I was really conscious of what I was doing; just at that time the thought of writing words on the internet that would be attributed to me and potentially be around forever, didn't seem like a big deal and a negative thought about it never crossed my mind.

Since deleting my LiveJournal, I've attempted creating what feels like a lot of blogs, all software development related. And for every one of them, I've followed the same pattern, which follows roughly the pattern of:

Pore over the technical details of which blogging platform to use (usally WordPress). Spend hours creating a design or theme. Spend additional hours thinking of a name and a matching domain name. Write up to 20 or so articles on various technical topics. Decide the internet doesn't need whatever I've written about or that my writing skills are so bad that all I've done is embarrass myself. Then delete the whole thing without a further moments consideration. Repeat the whole mess again in 12-18 months   

And so I suck at blogging. Because I get self conscious and delete my blogs, usually representing 10s and in at least one case 100s of hours of work by the time I delete them. Today I consume YouTube content in roughly the same quantities as I do oxygen. Having now followed some YouTubers for years and watched their content library, skills and subscribers grow, I know the only way to build any body of work that you can continue to build on and enjoy as a hobby and a log of your own journey is to just keep going with it.  

In any case, I'm repeating the pattern. This time around I've chosen NuxtJS with the Content module, Tailwind CSS, hosted on Github Pages. It does everything I want. Which is to write short articles in markdown and publish them straight from the command line with a quick `git push`. 

To be deleted soon, surely ;)

\* LiveJournal is still around today.
