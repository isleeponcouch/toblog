In 2025, you can likely benefit more from removing a piece of technology from your life rather than introducing something meant to improve it. 

Competition for our attention is fierce and people are becomming far more conscious of where they direct that attention with apps that turn your smartphone to a dumb phone, sales of actual dumb phones, and other apps designed to block things out rather than letting them in, massively on the rise.

I joined LinkedIn in the very early days of the platform, when it was kind of a niche thing and really only had tech people with a LinkedIn Badge linking to their profile on their WordPress blog. I think I originally signed up because I wanted that badge on my own blog.

Back then, I loved the idea. A place to keep the details of your career in an online resume type format, a way to find other people who are interested in what you're interested in when it comes to work stuff, and a place to send people from your blog for a more formal profile of you as a professional.

But we all know what LinkedIn has become. And so long as you have an account, you're always susceptible to the cesspool of weirdness it is today seeping into your attention span.

So after realising that after over a decade of having LinkedIn it has never once lead to an opportunity or otherwise helped my life or career in any way, I closed (not hibernated, closed) my account.

No more sifting through useless notifications from recruiters and 'InMail' spam in exchange for absolutely nothing.

Goodbye LinkedIn, you were...really just kind of annoying in the end.
