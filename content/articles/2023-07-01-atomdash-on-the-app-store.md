Introducing Atomdash, a periodic table and chemistry tutor app for iOS.

I spun up this project after looking for a simple periodic table app on iOS and finding that even though the space is crowded nothing gave me the feeling of a high quality native app experience. More importantly, there wasn't much in the way of actual chemistry tutoring. The iPad is home to so many great educational apps, but chemistry is a subject that has seemingly been neglected.

Atomdash goes further than just being a periodic table reference, though it is a high quality and detailed one if that's what you need. Students can customise their table to suit the style their institution or textbooks use, or just to suit their preference. Atomdash also provides a set of learning features to help students learn the basics of the periodic table of the elements and also to test and further their knowledge through customisable quizzes that can target specific knowledge areas.

Teachers can use Atomdash as a visual teaching aid with filters for class, periods and groups. There is also detailed information on each element.

Atomdash Roadmap (I'll update this post as I go)

- ~~Allow tiles to be configured and to allow hiding/showing of the atomic weight on the table~~ Added 17th July 2023
- ~~A mutable soundscape to increase engagement and use as a teaching aid~~ Added 17th July 2023
- ~~Quiz Builder: A detailed Quiz Builder feature to allow the creation of quizzes similar to the in-built quizzes.~~ Added 26th July 2023
- ~~History Mode: a visual teaching aid for teaching the discovery of the elements over time.~~ Added 6th September 2023
- ~~Bohr's Model: an interactive Bohr's model with electronic configuration visualisations.~~ Added 6th September 2023
- ~~Periodic Trend Quizzes such as electronegativity~~ Added 6th September 2023
- Balancing Tutorial/Quizzes: learning mode introducing and evaluating chemical equation balancing.
- ~~Theme System: Atomdash currently supports light and dark modes, but I want to take this further and allow users to choose their own theme. Because fun.~~
- Rutherford Gold Foil Experiment Simulation
- A tutorial to interactively introduce the periodic table
